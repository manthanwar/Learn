CHANGE MANAGEMENT


Changes, modifications and development of new software happes so fast and so frequent that it is essential to keep track of changes, enhancements and development of new work flow items and artifacts. The European Space Agency's Ariane 5 Flight 501 rocket disaster was caused by poor change management in reused software parts,[Finish Thesis, Minna Makarainen 2000]

I plan to use following keywords with subversion commit process.
This should allow to keep track of development workflow.

Version Control Codes:

NEW: New Features
CHG: Minor Changes
ENH: Major Enhancements
BUG: Bug Fixed
REM: Removed


City Location Based Codes:

HYD: Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh, India
PNQ: Pune, Maharashtra, India - Based on IATA Airport Code



Examples:

NEW: AMM HYD - New Feature    - by Amit M. Manthanwar developed at Hyderabad
CHG: AMM HYD - Changes        - by Amit M. Manthanwar developed at Hyderabad
ENH: AMM HYD - Enhancements   - by Amit M. Manthanwar at Hyderabad
BUG: AMM HYD - Bugs Fixed     - by Amit M. Manthanwar at Hyderabad
